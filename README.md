# Fit3094Week06

Title: FIT3094 Assessed Lab #2
Student: Jianquan Li


Description: The program contains two classes, which are boid and asteroid. Three different rules were implemented so that 
they can be used on the asteroids. I accidentally named wrong to these two classes, so boid is the one who is wandering, and 
asteroid is the one who is flocking. 
Please notice, the level provided from Moodle was not found on my device, no matter how i tried, it did not show up in my UE4.
So I created my own one.
